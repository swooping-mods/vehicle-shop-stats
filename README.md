# Vehicle Shop Statistics

Compare vehicles in a separate specifications grid without changing descriptions.

## Install

Install [Moon Sweepers Mod Loader](https://github.com/swooping-mods/moon-sweepers-mod-loader) first.

Download [vehicle-shop-stats-0.2.0.msmod](content/vehicle-shop-stats-0.2.0.msmod), then drag and drop the `.msmod` file onto the [Moon Sweepers Mod Loader](https://github.com/swooping-mods/moon-sweepers-mod-loader) window. You can also use **Add mods…** (older loader builds: **Install mod package**).

Select the mod and its required frameworks, click **Prepare files**, then **Launch**.

## Controls

- Open the garage Vehicles page to compare a separate specifications grid.
- Descriptions stay in their original area; statistics never replace them.

## Compatibility

Version 0.2.0. Targets the pinned Steam Windows x64 IL2CPP build of Moon Sweepers (Steam app 5335510). On Linux, the game runs through Proton. Experimental: back up saves before using save-affecting mods.

## Build

Run `python3 build.py --check` to verify source hashes, then `python3 build.py` to write a build under `.local/build/`. Requires installed Clang, lld-link and llvm-dlltool.
